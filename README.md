# 0xee's emacs init configuration

## Setup

just download this project and add load `init.el` in your `.emacs`, eg.
```
(load-file "~/emacs-init/init.el")
```

It is best to start out with an empty `.emacs.d` directory. On first start, missing packages are automatically installed from the ELPA/MELPA repositories.
